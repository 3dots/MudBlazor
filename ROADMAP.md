# MudBlazor Roadmap

MudBlazor is stable and no big development is going on at the moment. Since this is a non-commercial project we rely heavily on our users for bug fixes. 
We try to merge important bug fixes as soon as possible. If your bug-fix PR is overlooked, make sure to tag a team member. 

## Future .NET Versions
.NET 7 is fully supported. Supporting future .NET versions is our top priority.

## Upcoming Breaking Changes

However, since we have put off breaking changes for a very long time, we'll 
merge all breaking changes and remove all obsolete parameters when we move to v7 in early 2023.

For all who can't upgrade their projects to v7 we will maintain v6 for some time, primarily by merging your bug fixes and backports.

## Future Lookout

We do our best to merge your bug fixes. Please don't expect 
the team to fix bugs for you, everyone participating in this project is doing it in their own precious free time and it is simply 
impossible for us to provide free support for everyone. That being said, we feel responsible for MudBlazor and will ensure its
future by merging important bug fixes and features if we deem them significantly useful for most users.
